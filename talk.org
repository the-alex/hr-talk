* Why, though?
** Things are fast on the command line
[[https://adamdrake.com/command-line-tools-can-be-235x-faster-than-your-hadoop-cluster.html][sometimes crazy fast]]
** Remote machines
/"The Cloud"/ is just other people's computers. Sometimes they don't have a
screen.
** Old tech is well documented and reliable
** Your environment is not what serves in prod
- nix
- Docker
- Linux
* Humility
** There's no way to know everything
- Everything comes with time.
- Helps to know a bigger nerd. Mentorship is everything.
** Don't repeat yourself!
Stay /DRY/, kids
** Being fancy doesn't always mean being fast (or good ...)
